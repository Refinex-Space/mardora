## Making Changes

### Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names:

- `feature/add-table-plugin` – New features
- `fix/image-rendering-bug` – Bug fixes
- `docs/update-readme` – Documentation
- `refactor/plugin-architecture` – Code refactoring

### Commit Messages

Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
feat: add table plugin support
fix: resolve image widget rendering issue
docs: update installation instructions
refactor: simplify plugin registration
chore: update dependencies
```

### Changesets

We use [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) for versioning. If your change affects the public API or fixes a bug, add a changeset:

```bash
bun run changeset
```

Follow the prompts to describe your changes. This creates a file in `.changeset/` that will be used to generate the changelog.

---

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. **Sync with upstream**:

   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```

2. **Push your branch**:

   ```bash
   git push origin your-branch-name
   ```

3. **Open a Pull Request** on GitHub against the `main` branch.

4. **Fill out the PR template** with:
   - A clear description of the changes
   - Related issue numbers (if any)
   - Screenshots for UI changes

5. **Wait for review** – maintainers will review your PR and may request changes.

---

## Coding Guidelines

### TypeScript

- Use strict TypeScript – avoid `any` where possible.
- Export types from `index.ts` files.
- Use descriptive variable and function names.

### Code Style

- We use **Prettier** for formatting – run `bun run format` before committing.
- We use **ESLint** for linting – run `bun run lint` to check for issues.

### Plugins

When creating a new plugin:

1. Create a new file in `packages/draftly/src/plugins/`.
2. Extend the `DraftlyPlugin` base class.
3. Export the plugin from `packages/draftly/src/plugins/index.ts`.
4. Add the plugin to `allPlugins` array if it should be included by default.
5. Update documentation if needed.

### Testing

- Test your changes in the playground app (`apps/web`).
- Ensure the build passes: `bun run build`.
- Ensure linting passes: `bun run lint`.
